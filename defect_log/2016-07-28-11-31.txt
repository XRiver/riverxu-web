Defect: name_response.jsp cannot get parameter "answer"(get as null) set by FirstTestServlet (with request.setParameter("answer",NOT NULL?));
    but the JSP can get "name" which was generated by <form> in index.jsp.
Type: Interface
Possible reason: 1. request.setParameter() method is invalid.
    2. The String is null itself.
Reason: Used wrong method in JSP page. Expected getAttribute(), but was getParameter()

Fix method: Corrected the method used in name_response.jsp.
