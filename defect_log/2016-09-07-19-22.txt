Defect: PHP string cannot process Chinese each characters as a whole.
Type: Function
Possible reason: //
Reason: Browser encode Chinese content in URL(each character in %ab%cd%ef, taking 3 bytes' storage), but in PHP each byte stands for a character.
    "徐江河" takes 9 bytes, so $POST["name"][0] is not 徐.
Fix time: Unsolved
