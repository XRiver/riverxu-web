Defect: PHP string cannot process Chinese each characters as a whole.
Type: Function
Possible reason: //
Reason: Browser encode Chinese content in URL(each character in %ab%cd%ef, taking 3 bytes' storage), but in PHP each byte stands for a character.
    "徐江河" takes 9 bytes, so $POST["name"][0] is not 徐.
Fix time: 2016-09-07-20-02 (Unsolved, but avoided)
Fix method: In PHP, each Chinese character takes 3 bytes(UTF8), and we cannot make strlen("徐江河")==3. It has to be 9!
