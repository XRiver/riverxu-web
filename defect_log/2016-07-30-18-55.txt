Defect: ServletContext.getResourceAsStream() cannot retrieve File created by File.createTempFile()
Type: Function
Possible reason: 1. Wrong way of creating File
    2. Wrong way of specifying resource(f.getAbsolutePath()?)
Reason: 1 ; Not specifying character encoding when writing into file; Not setting content-type to binary flow(otherwise Chrome would cache and open it in itself)
Fix time: 2016-07-30-20-30
Fix method: OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(f),"UTF-8");
    ...
    response.setContentType("application/octet-stream");
	response.setCharacterEncoding("utf-8");
	response.addHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=result.txt");
