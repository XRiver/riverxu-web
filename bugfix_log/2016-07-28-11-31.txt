Bug: name_response.jsp cannot get parameter "answer"(get as null) set by FirstTestServlet (with request.setParameter("answer",NOT NULL?));
    but the JSP can get "name" which was generated by <form> in index.jsp.
Possible reason: 1. request.setParameter() method is invalid.
Fix time: Not yet
Fix method: None
